Functions for interacting with the Diffbot API

This is a work in progress and is going to take some time to build out. There is no guaranteed support for this library at this time. Ultimately, I'd like to build a number of features to easily interact with the Diffbot API via Python to enable quick and easy dashboarding, analysis, and so forth.

Right now, there's not much here - just a set of helper functions to parse responses from the API and convert the data into a tabular form for consumption by your typical analyst (yeah, I know, kind of defeats the purpose of the graph database).
