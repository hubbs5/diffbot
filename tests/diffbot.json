For quite some time, the United States has been conspicuously on the sideline. The American AI research community has, by and large, bemoaned the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/12/technology/china-trump-artificial-intelligence.html\"> lack of Federal leadership </a> in this space with many calling for a Kennedy-esque &ldquo;moonshot&rdquo; plan to come out of Washington to cement American leadership in the AI space. This past month, the Trump White House released the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-maintaining-american-leadership-artificial-intelligence/\"> <em> Executive Order on Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence </em> </a> to provide direction and support for technological advancement in this space.</p>\n<p>The response to the EO from the research community has been muted at best. Far from receiving the requested moonshot with the requisite funding and supporting agencies, this EO mostly lays out principles for AI development to be followed by Federal departments. It directs agencies towards prioritization of AI by using existing funds and to seek out collaboration efforts. Further, it directs the National Science and Technology Council Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence (among other agencies) to draw up plans and coordinate efforts among Federal agencies to develop grants, project proposals, and reports to be written on areas of development and collaboration within the next 180 days. Beyond that, there is very little concrete action laid out in the EO, which is why it has been criticized so heavily by those in the research community.</p>\n<p>In other words, the research community apparently feels the EO doesn&rsquo;t go far enough.</p>\n<p>In truth, however, even this limited EO goes much too far.</p>\n<p>Yes, AI has been hailed as a <a href=\"https://medium.com/syncedreview/artificial-intelligence-is-the-new-electricity-andrew-ng-cc132ea6264\"> transformative family of technologies </a> that will bring about a radically improved standard of living for people around the globe. On the other hand, there are numerous potential uses of this technology to <a href=\"https://maliciousaireport.com/\"> inflict incredible harm on individuals</a>, and the risk of abuse becomes greater the more AI research is funded or directed by government agencies. Malinvestment (or &ldquo;malscience,&rdquo; in this case) is encouraged by political funding of R&amp;D, and the Pentagon has explicitly stated they seek to use this technology in military applications. Rather than not going far enough, Trump&rsquo;s Executive Order has already gone too far by explicitly bringing this technology into the political realm because <a href=\"https://mises.org/library/state-too-dangerous-tolerate\"> the state is simply too dangerous</a> to grant a leading role in AI development.</p>\n<h3>Chinese AI Spectre</h3>\n<p>The obvious backdrop to Trump&rsquo;s new executive order is the plethora of <a href=\"https://www.cnas.org/publications/reports/understanding-chinas-ai-strategy\"> articles and reports </a> coming out of China regarding the Chinese Communist Party&rsquo;s (CCP) high-profile investments and <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608324/china-plans-to-use-artificial-intelligence-to-gain-global-economic-dominance-by-2030/\"> multi-year plans to AI dominance</a>. Most notable is China&rsquo;s <em> <a href=\"https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/digichina/blog/full-translation-chinas-new-generation-artificial-intelligence-development-plan-2017/\"> New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan </a> </em> (AIDP) released in July 2017 which makes the technology a key priority for government funding.</p>\n<p>Citing challenges from an aging population, environmental concerns, and economic growth, the report sees AI as a technology which, &ldquo;brings new opportunities for social construction.&rdquo; The report then lays out milestones over the next few years: by 2020 they will be on par with the global leaders in AI development with; 2025 plans to see Chinese companies achieving their own innovative breakthroughs in algorithmic development; 2030 they plan to be the undisputed leader in AI technology. Each milestone contains targets for the core industry and the supporting businesses that comprise the wider, industrial AI ecosystem.</p>\n<p>On top of the proposed industrial targets, the Chinese plan lays out a series of research areas such as swarm intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, security, natural language processing, AI hardware and infrastructure among others to focus their efforts on.</p>\n<p>The Chinese plan is widely seen as the gold standard in national AI plans; it is comprehensive, lays out specific targets, and discusses ways to accelerate adoption including by forcing enterprises and cities to adopt the technology. Moreover, resources have already been allocated to achieving these goals such as the <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/tech/innovation/article/2146428/tianjin-city-china-eyes-us16-billion-fund-ai-work-dwarfing-eus-plan\"> $15.7 fund earmarked by the city of Tianjin </a> to develop AI and the <a href=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/chinese-ai-startups-raised-5b-in-vc-funding-last-year-outpacing-the-us/\"> $500 million lead Chinese AI startups </a> have over US-based startups in receiving VC funding. China&rsquo;s AI plan and the top-down approach the CCP is pursuing is a major reason why Kai-Fu Lu&rsquo;s recent book, <em> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VZqZ00\"> AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order</a></em>, sees China steam rolling to success on the global stage.</p>\n<h3>AI Winters and Government Funding</h3>\n<p>The calls for more government funding by AI researchers, however, appear to lack historical perspective. Federal funding of AI projects is hardly anything new. The Advanced Research Projects Agency (now known as DARPA) provided <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TDiLy7\">$2.2 million grants</a> (equivalent to $18.2 million in 2019) to MIT, Carnegie Mellon University, and Stanford University in 1963.<sup><a href=\"https://mises.org/wire/dangers-government-funded-artificial-intelligence#footnote1_3yadfjf\">1</a> </sup> These institutions became the pioneers of AI research and had great, early success with new models such as an early precursor to today&rsquo;s artificial neural networks called the <em> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron\"> perceptron</a></em>. Additional optimism came from success in translating Russian to English via machine translation. However, the early optimism of AI dried up quickly when, in 1966, it was reported that machine translation was incapable of sufficiently capturing the nuances of Russian.<a href=\"https://mises.org/wire/dangers-government-funded-artificial-intelligence#footnote2_8xoz30k\">2</a> Second, Marvin Minksy&rsquo;s book <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2UDhoM5\">Perceptrons</a></em> proved that these simple, early models were incapable of learning very much at all. This killed research into neural networks for the next decade. The vast majority of funding was government related, and once it was pulled, plunged the field into the first AI winter.</p>\n<p>A resurgence came later in the 1980s as companies in the US, Britain, and Japan began to invest in <em>expert systems</em> &ndash; rule-based programs that are a precursor to today&rsquo;s Robotic Process Automation (RPA) movement. This led to a rise in AI labs throughout many companies which were able to automate many simple decisions and reap the rewards associated with greater efficiency. Although the private AI market grew to roughly $1 billion by the end of the decade, these systems were shown to be brittle and unable to extend to more challenging domains.</p>\n<p>In 1982, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry funded and established the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_generation_computer\"> Fifth Generation Computer Systems </a> based on a 10-year plan to develop new computer systems and set Japan as the international leader. This spawned a series of international competitors and plans to stay ahead of the Japanese most notably the European Strategic Program on Research and Information Technology, the Strategic Computing Initiative and Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation in the US. The Japanese project failed to deliver on its lofty goals of developing a new computing system as it was overtaken by Sun Systems and Intel despite over $400 billion in funding ($730 billion in 2019).</p>\n<p>The Fifth Generation&rsquo;s competing projects ended in similar results. For example, the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2T9PQwr\"> Strategic Computing Initiative </a> spent $1 billion from 1983-1993 ($2.2 billion in 2019) to achieve machine intelligence.<a href=\"https://mises.org/wire/dangers-government-funded-artificial-intelligence#footnote3_wqwenam\">3</a> Although there were some successful spin-off projects (e.g. Carnegie Mellon&rsquo;s Navlab), the Initiative itself was a failure and was a major contributor to the second AI winter when it collapsed.</p>\n<p>If only inefficiency was the only concern of large-scale, government funded AI research! Unfortunately, the White House, Pentagon, Congress, and others have indicated that they have much more destructive ends in mind.</p>\n<h3>Weaponization of AI</h3>\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s Executive Order refers to AI in the context of &ldquo;national security&rdquo; nearly a dozen times. The day after the Executive Order was released, the Pentagon released its <a href=\"http://chrome-extension://oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm/https://media.defense.gov/2019/Feb/12/2002088963/-1/-1/1/SUMMARY-OF-DOD-AI-STRATEGY.PDF\"> AI strategy document </a> calling for rapid AI adoption throughout all aspects of the military. The Pentagon had previously contracted with Google to develop Project Maven, a computer vision system to assist object recognition for drone warfare. Google agreed <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/google-plans-not-to-renew-its-contract-for-project-mave-1826488620\"> not to renew the contract </a> after dozens of employees resigned in protest and thousands more petitioned the company to refrain from developing weaponized AI tools. This led to Google <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/google-sets-limits-on-its-use-of-ai-but-allows-defense-work/\"> restricting its defense work,</a> but military projects are still permitted.</p>\n<p>Despite the push back that Google has received, other big tech companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM continue to engage in <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/26/microsoft-amazon-pledge-work-with-pentagon-following-anonymous-online-rebukes/?utm_term=.f523922ed3c3\"> work supporting the weaponization of AI with the Pentagon</a>. These companies too have had to deal with internal discontent and have resorted to moving employees to different projects when they object. Despite the internal challenges, Amazon continues to work with the government <a href=\"https://medium.com/s/powertrip/im-an-amazon-employee-my-company-shouldn-t-sell-facial-recognition-tech-to-police-36b5fde934ac\"> on controversial facial recognition programs</a> and Microsoft has continued with a <a href=\"https://www.fedscoop.com/dont-bid-jedi-employees-tell-microsoft/\"> cloud-computing project known as JEDI</a>.</p>\n<p>For now, the Pentagon has been <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-pentagon-needs-to-woo-ai-experts-away-from-big-tech/\"> unable to attract the talent </a> required to develop AI technologies internally and thus has had to resort to partnering with the likes of the big tech firms. In China, the funding and control of these companies is linked directly to the CCP, which has given rise to the <em> <a href=\"https://www.artificiallyintelligent.tech/episode-72-sesame-credit-chinas-new-citizen-score/\"> Sesame Credit</a></em> system. At the risk of sounding cliche, Sesame Credit is an Orwellian system of social control predicated on the complicity of big tech companies and AI to track the citizenry&rsquo;s purchases and behaviors, incentivizing them to behave in party-approved ways and punishing them when they veer away. Punishments include restrictions on travel, loans, housing, business, and banking. The <a href=\"http://time.com/collection/davos-2019/5502592/china-social-credit-score/\"> official goal of the program is to encompass all citizens and</a>, &ldquo;allow the trustworthy to roam everywhere under heaven, while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Perhaps most insidiously, it encourages social ostracization by reducing your score based on the score of those in your network. Thus you are encouraged to drop friends and family from your life if they aren&rsquo;t behaving in a party-approved manner.</p>\n<p>While the US is not China, we are living in a world where the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2W6ohWJ\"> NSA has obliterated 4th Amendment rights </a> and where <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2017/01/30/obama-killed-a-16-year-old-american-in-yemen-trump-just-killed-his-8-year-old-sister/\"> US presidents assert the legal authority to kill US citizens </a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/14/13577464/obama-farewell-speech-torture-drones-nsa-surveillance-trump\"> without charges or a trial</a>. A national AI strategy that further links the US government with the tech companies and researchers puts us one step closer to China, but not as a leader in AI, rather as a country that leverages this technology to suppress people. One can only hope that backlash associated with Project Maven grows with respect to other Pentagon projects leaving the Department of Defense without the capabilities to weaponize AI as they seek.</p>\n<ul> <li><a href=\"https://mises.org/wire/dangers-government-funded-artificial-intelligence#footnoteref1_3yadfjf\">1.</a> Crevier, Daniel, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TDiLy7\"><em>AI: The Tumultuous Search for Artificial Intelligence</em></a>, (New York, NY: BasicBooks, 1993) pg. 64-65</li> <li><a href=\"https://mises.org/wire/dangers-government-funded-artificial-intelligence#footnoteref2_8xoz30k\">2.</a> &ldquo;The famous retranslation of &lsquo;the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak&rsquo; as &lsquo;the vodka is good but the meat is rotten&rsquo; illustrates the difficulties encountered.&rdquo; Russell, Stuart J., Norvig, Peter, <em> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2F4H51v\"> Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach </a> </em> , (Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall 2009) pg. 21</li> <li><a href=\"https://mises.org/wire/dangers-government-funded-artificial-intelligence#footnoteref3_wqwenam\">3.</a> Roland, Alex, Shirman, Philip, and Aspray, William, <em> <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2T9PQwr\"> Strategic Computing: DARPA and the Quest for Machine Intelligence, 1983-1993 </a> </em> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2002) pg. 2</li> </ul>\n<p>Christian Hubbs is a PhD candidate at Carnegie Mellon University working in machine learning and optimization.

Social understanding of the reality of marijuana use is slowly coming to pass; it is now uncommon for many people to believe the tired half-truths and aggressive propaganda foisted by D.A.R.E and other Law Enforcement Agencies surrounding the cannabis plant.</p>\n<h3>Racism, Ignorance Mostly to Blame for Prohibition</h3>\n<p>Initially, prohibition of marijuana or &ldquo;marihuana&rdquo; in the Western world was primarily a racist backlash against Mexican workers and other immigrants who worked in the southern states of the United States &ndash; later that focus would shift to black Jazz musicians and other social minorities and marginals who were easily cast as &ldquo;the Other&rdquo; to a largely white, suburban demographic.</p>\n<p>To read more about the basis of marijuana prohibition, <a href=\"https://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2464&context=etd_hon_theses\">please click here</a>.</p>\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"http://activistpost.com/cbd\">Organically Grown CBD Oil and Products Available (Ad)</a></strong></em></p>\n<h3>History, Medicinal Use of a Relatively Benign Substance</h3>\n<p>The history of cannabis does not begin there, however &ndash; <em>it is a plant that has been used since at least well before the time of Jesus Christ to reduce pain, to relax the body and soul, and to heal and alleviate sickness and the associated symptoms of many illnesses.</em> In the history of civilized existence, there have been exactly zero cases of death directly attributed to marijuana use &ndash; <a href=\"https://www.drugabuse.gov/publications/drugfacts/marijuana\">according to the National Institute of Drug Abuse</a> (NIDA).</p>\n<p><em>It is physically impossible to overdose on marijuana.</em> Further, medical research suggests that it is impossible to develop a physical addiction to cannabis as well. While long-term marijuana smoking has been shown to increase the chance of developing bronchitis, evidence compiled by the largest case-controlled study of its kind by Dr. Donald Tashkin indicates <em>absolutely no correlation between heavy use of marijuana and increased incidence of lung cancers. (</em><a href=\"https://health.usnews.com/health-care/patient-advice/articles/2017-11-24/is-there-a-connection-between-copd-and-marijuana-smoking\">Source</a><em>)</em></p>\n<p>By comparing and contrasting these facts alone with those surrounding socially accepted drugs such as tobacco and alcohol &ndash; let alone a plethora of toxic and extremely addictive prescription pharmaceuticals &ndash; the hypocrisy surrounding the &ldquo;War on Drugs&rdquo; becomes evident to most critical thinkers.</p>\n<h3>The Real Cost of the &ldquo;War on Drugs&rdquo;</h3>\n<p>Aside from the tens of billions of dollars in lucrative federal revenue that could be accumulated by simple legalization and taxation of the cannabis plant, and also not accounting for the millions of dollars spent enforcing antiquated prohibition laws &ndash; there is a very real human cost associated with the &ldquo;War on Drugs.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>In 2017 alone, there were 659,700 people arrested on marijuana-related charges in the United States. <em>Of those persons 599,282 were arrested for simple possession</em>. In other words, more than half a million persons a year in the United States are arrested for choosing a safer, healthier, and more productive medicine or recreational drug than alcohol, tobacco, prescription pharmaceuticals, or even aspirin &ndash; aspirin being responsible for thousands of deaths per year in the United States.</p>\n<p><em>In a society that supposedly rests a great deal of its foundation on the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness &ndash; it seems extremely hypocritical, illogical, and farcical to continue this misguided and propaganda-fueled war on our fellow citizens.</em> When heart disease (heavily influenced by extremely fatty diets and obesity) continues to be the leading cause of death of death in America &ndash; <a href=\"https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/why-good-nutrition-important\">killing over 1800 people each day</a> &ndash; it seems foolish and unjust to jail more than half a million persons a year in the West for choosing a substance which has never killed a single human being since its recorded use.</p>\n<p><strong>Arjun is an independent researcher, writer, speaker and a consciousness activist.

Not surprisingly, <strong>students have been reportedly suffering from more than cancer</strong> since that tower was installed. From a <a href=\"https://www.gopetition.com/petitions/remove-towers-from-ripon-unified-school-district.html\">2017 petition</a> to remove the tower:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Eight years later we are now seeing the probable effects of the installation of this tower . Two 5th grade students were diagnosed with cancer during the 2016-2017 school year. They have both attended Weston Elementary since Kindergarten.

CIBC, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, is one of the five biggest banks in Canada. Yesterday just happened to be the day that people receiving welfare, unemployment benefits, social insurance payments (like American social security), Canada Pension payments, and disability payments landed in the accounts of recipients.</p>\n<p>Customers could still use ATMs and Point of Sale features but were unable to log into their accounts to check balances, transfer money, or make online payments.

And we think it&rsquo;s going to get to 96 per cent over the next four to five years.&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://business.financialpost.com/news/fp-street/in-person-banking-soon-to-be-a-rarity-cibc-ceo-says-as-customers-continue-to-migrate-online\">source</a>)</p></blockquote>\n<p>But perhaps this migration has more to do with CIBC closing branches. Physical locations where you can walk in and see a teller are going the way of the Canadian penny. (It&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_(Canadian_coin)\">no longer being made</a> because production costs were 1.6 cents per coin.)</p>\n<p>Since <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/cibc-to-close-at-least-60-more-branches/article25457080/\">before 2000</a>, CIBC has been closing <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/cibc-to-close-as-many-as-150-branches/article25280813/\">dozens of branches</a> every year. And it isn&rsquo;t just CIBC that is closing branches in Canada. It&rsquo;s a trend across<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/01/11/banks-closures-canada_n_14111896.html\"> all the Big 5 banks and thousands of jobs</a> have been lost.</p>\n<p>So the question is, do Canadians actually &ldquo;prefer&rdquo; online banking, or do they have no other choice due to physical location closures?</p>\n<h3>This makes me think of the whole push toward a cashless society.</h3>\n<p>For a long time now, Big Finance has been &ldquo;nudging&rdquo; people along toward an end that would benefit them greatly &ndash; a cashless society.</p>\n<blockquote><p>If a powerful institution wants to make people choose a certain thing, the best strategy is to make it difficult to choose the alternative.</p> <p>We can illustrate this with the example of self-checkout tills at supermarkets. The underlying agenda is to replace checkout staff with self-service machines to cut costs. But supermarkets have to convince their customers. They thus initially present self-checkout as a convenient alternative. When some people then use that alternative, the supermarket can cite that as evidence of a change in customer behaviour, which they then use to justify a reduction in checkout employees. This in turn makes it more inconvenient to use the checkout staff, which in turn makes customers more likely to use the machines. They slowly wean you off staff, and &ldquo;nudge&rdquo; you towards self-service.</p> <p>Financial institutions, likewise, are trying to nudge us towards a cashless society and digital banking. The true motive is corporate profit. Payments companies such as Visa and Mastercard want to increase the volume of digital payments services they sell, while banks want to cut costs. The nudge requires two parts. First, they must increase the inconvenience of cash, ATMs and branches. Second, they must vigorously promote the alternative. They seek to make people &ldquo;learn&rdquo; that they want digital, and then &ldquo;choose&rdquo; it. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/19/cashless-society-con-big-finance-banks-closing-atms\">source</a>)</p></blockquote>\n<p>It won&rsquo;t surprise many people to learn that this has links to Marxist philosophy.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The Italian philosopher <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"1\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/antonio-gramsci-3026471\">Antonio Gramsci</a> developed the concept of cultural hegemony out of <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"2\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/karl-marx-contributions-to-sociology-3026477\">Karl Marx&rsquo;s theory</a> that the dominant ideology of society reflects the beliefs and interests of the ruling class. Gramsci argued that consent to the rule of the dominant group is achieved by the spread of ideologies&mdash;beliefs, assumptions, and values&mdash;through social institutions such as schools, churches, courts, and the media, among others. These institutions do <a data-component=\"link\" data-ordinal=\"3\" data-source=\"inlineLink\" data-type=\"internalLink\" href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/socialization-in-sociology-4104466\">the work of socializing people</a> into the norms, values, and beliefs of the dominant social group. As such, the group that controls these institutions controls the rest of society.</p> <p>Cultural hegemony is most strongly manifested when those ruled by the dominant group come to believe that the economic and social conditions of their society are natural and inevitable, rather than created by people with a vested interest in particular social, economic, and political orders. (<a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/cultural-hegemony-3026121\">source</a>)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Oh yay. Who doesn&rsquo;t love being &ldquo;nudged&rdquo; along the road to Marxism and a cashless utopia? (This is sarcasm. Hold the angry comments and emails.)</p>\n<h3>Here&rsquo;s why a cashless society is dangerous.</h3>\n<p>A cashless society is a danger to freedom. And this is why we should embrace cold hard cash, precious metals, and the barter system.</p>\n<p>Most of the folks who will read this article will already be on board with this philosophy, but here is one of the best explanations I&rsquo;ve read about the dangers. From <em>The UK Guardian</em>&hellip;</p>\n<blockquote><p>Digital systems may be &ldquo;convenient&rdquo;, but they often come with central points of failure. Cash, on the other hand, does not crash. It does not rely on external data centres, and is not subject to remote control or remote monitoring. The cash system allows for an unmonitored &ldquo;off the grid&rdquo; space. This is also the reason why financial institutions and <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-is-fintech_us_58a20d80e4b0cd37efcfebaa\">financial technology</a> companies want to get rid of it. Cash transactions are outside the net that such institutions cast to harvest fees and data.</p>  <p>A cashless society brings dangers. People without bank accounts will find themselves further marginalised, disenfranchised from the cash infrastructure that previously supported them. There are also poorly understood <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/blog/2014/feb/15/cashless-society-no-pain-no-gain-plastic-future\">psychological implications about cash</a> encouraging self-control while paying by card or a mobile phone can encourage spending. And a cashless society has <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/13/cash-digitise-payments-money-cashless\">major surveillance implications</a>.</p> <p>Despite this, <strong>we see an alignment between government and financial institutions.</strong> The Treasury recently held a public consultation on <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/cash-and-digital-payments-in-the-new-economy\">cash and digital payments in the new economy</a>. It presented itself as attempting to strike a balance, noting that cash was still important. But years of subtle lobbying by the financial industry have clearly paid off. The <a data-link-name=\"in body link\" href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/689234/Cash_and_digital_payments_in_the_new_economy.pdf\">call for evidence </a>repeatedly notes the negative elements of cash &ndash; associating it with crime and tax evasion &ndash; but barely mentions the negative implications of digital payments.</p> <p>The UK government has chosen to champion the digital financial services industry. This is irresponsible and disingenuous. We need to stop accepting stories about the cashless society and hyper-digital banking being &ldquo;natural progress&rdquo;. We must recognise every cash machine that is shut down as another step in financial institutions&rsquo; campaign to nudge you into their digital enclosures. (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/19/cashless-society-con-big-finance-banks-closing-atms\">source</a>)</p></blockquote>\n<p>It only took one day of the CIBC debacle to remind people of why digital transactions are at the mercy of the computers and those who control them.</p>\n<p>The people who are pleading for the &ldquo;progress&rdquo; of a cashless society, the ones who can&rsquo;t wait to get their debit card <a href=\"https://www.theorganicprepper.com/everyone-will-get-a-microchip/\">embedded into their arms as an RFID chip</a> &ndash; they aren&rsquo;t seeing the bigger picture. That&rsquo;s the picture of them, losing everything they have at the whim of a bank, a prosecutor, or a computer error. It&rsquo;s the picture of every single thing you buy and every transaction you make being tracked, filed away, and one day used against you.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s all about control. It&rsquo;s <em>always</em> about control.</p>\n<p>And without cash, you just handed all of your control to someone else.</p>\n<h4><em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/girlofcelje/status/1045746778597863424\">Hat tip to Connie from Canada</a></em></h4>\n<p><em>Please feel free to share any information from this site in part or in full, leaving all links intact, giving credit to the author and including a link to this website and the following bio.

                "text": "Artificial Intelligence is widely seen as a strategic technology and has thus engendered national development plans from countries across the globe to promote its progress. For quite some time, the United States has been conspicuously on the sideline. The American AI research community has, by and large, bemoaned the lack of Federal leadership in this space with many calling for a Kennedy-esque \u201cmoonshot\u201d plan to come out of Washington to cement American leadership in the AI space. This past month, the Trump White House released the Executive Order on Maintaining American Leadership in Artificial Intelligence to provide direction and support for technological advancement in this space.\nThe response to the EO from the research community has been muted at best. Far from receiving the requested moonshot with the requisite funding and supporting agencies, this EO mostly lays out principles for AI development to be followed by Federal departments. It directs agencies towards prioritization of AI by using existing funds and to seek out collaboration efforts. Further, it directs the National Science and Technology Council Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence (among other agencies) to draw up plans and coordinate efforts among Federal agencies to develop grants, project proposals, and reports to be written on areas of development and collaboration within the next 180 days. Beyond that, there is very little concrete action laid out in the EO, which is why it has been criticized so heavily by those in the research community.\nIn other words, the research community apparently feels the EO doesn\u2019t go far enough.\nIn truth, however, even this limited EO goes much too far.\nYes, AI has been hailed as a transformative family of technologies that will bring about a radically improved standard of living for people around the globe. On the other hand, there are numerous potential uses of this technology to inflict incredible harm on individuals, and the risk of abuse becomes greater the more AI research is funded or directed by government agencies. Malinvestment (or \u201cmalscience,\u201d in this case) is encouraged by political funding of R&D, and the Pentagon has explicitly stated they seek to use this technology in military applications. Rather than not going far enough, Trump\u2019s Executive Order has already gone too far by explicitly bringing this technology into the political realm because the state is simply too dangerous to grant a leading role in AI development.\nChinese AI Spectre\nThe obvious backdrop to Trump\u2019s new executive order is the plethora of articles and reports coming out of China regarding the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s (CCP) high-profile investments and multi-year plans to AI dominance. Most notable is China\u2019s New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan (AIDP) released in July 2017 which makes the technology a key priority for government funding.\nCiting challenges from an aging population, environmental concerns, and economic growth, the report sees AI as a technology which, \u201cbrings new opportunities for social construction.\u201d The report then lays out milestones over the next few years: by 2020 they will be on par with the global leaders in AI development with; 2025 plans to see Chinese companies achieving their own innovative breakthroughs in algorithmic development; 2030 they plan to be the undisputed leader in AI technology. Each milestone contains targets for the core industry and the supporting businesses that comprise the wider, industrial AI ecosystem.\nOn top of the proposed industrial targets, the Chinese plan lays out a series of research areas such as swarm intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, security, natural language processing, AI hardware and infrastructure among others to focus their efforts on.\nThe Chinese plan is widely seen as the gold standard in national AI plans; it is comprehensive, lays out specific targets, and discusses ways to accelerate adoption including by forcing enterprises and cities to adopt the technology. Moreover, resources have already been allocated to achieving these goals such as the $15.7 fund earmarked by the city of Tianjin to develop AI and the $500 million lead Chinese AI startups have over US-based startups in receiving VC funding. China\u2019s AI plan and the top-down approach the CCP is pursuing is a major reason why Kai-Fu Lu\u2019s recent book, AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, sees China steam rolling to success on the global stage.\nAI Winters and Government Funding\nThe calls for more government funding by AI researchers, however, appear to lack historical perspective. Federal funding of AI projects is hardly anything new. The Advanced Research Projects Agency (now known as DARPA) provided $2.2 million grants (equivalent to $18.2 million in 2019) to MIT, Carnegie Mellon University, and Stanford University in 1963.1 These institutions became the pioneers of AI research and had great, early success with new models such as an early precursor to today\u2019s artificial neural networks called the perceptron. Additional optimism came from success in translating Russian to English via machine translation. However, the early optimism of AI dried up quickly when, in 1966, it was reported that machine translation was incapable of sufficiently capturing the nuances of Russian.2 Second, Marvin Minksy\u2019s book Perceptrons proved that these simple, early models were incapable of learning very much at all. This killed research into neural networks for the next decade. The vast majority of funding was government related, and once it was pulled, plunged the field into the first AI winter.\nA resurgence came later in the 1980s as companies in the US, Britain, and Japan began to invest in expert systems \u2013 rule-based programs that are a precursor to today\u2019s Robotic Process Automation (RPA) movement. This led to a rise in AI labs throughout many companies which were able to automate many simple decisions and reap the rewards associated with greater efficiency. Although the private AI market grew to roughly $1 billion by the end of the decade, these systems were shown to be brittle and unable to extend to more challenging domains.\nIn 1982, the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry funded and established the Fifth Generation Computer Systems based on a 10-year plan to develop new computer systems and set Japan as the international leader. This spawned a series of international competitors and plans to stay ahead of the Japanese most notably the European Strategic Program on Research and Information Technology, the Strategic Computing Initiative and Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation in the US. The Japanese project failed to deliver on its lofty goals of developing a new computing system as it was overtaken by Sun Systems and Intel despite over $400 billion in funding ($730 billion in 2019).\nThe Fifth Generation\u2019s competing projects ended in similar results. For example, the Strategic Computing Initiative spent $1 billion from 1983-1993 ($2.2 billion in 2019) to achieve machine intelligence.3 Although there were some successful spin-off projects (e.g. Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Navlab), the Initiative itself was a failure and was a major contributor to the second AI winter when it collapsed.\nIf only inefficiency was the only concern of large-scale, government funded AI research! Unfortunately, the White House, Pentagon, Congress, and others have indicated that they have much more destructive ends in mind.\nWeaponization of AI\nTrump\u2019s Executive Order refers to AI in the context of \u201cnational security\u201d nearly a dozen times. The day after the Executive Order was released, the Pentagon released its AI strategy document calling for rapid AI adoption throughout all aspects of the military. The Pentagon had previously contracted with Google to develop Project Maven, a computer vision system to assist object recognition for drone warfare. Google agreed not to renew the contract after dozens of employees resigned in protest and thousands more petitioned the company to refrain from developing weaponized AI tools. This led to Google restricting its defense work, but military projects are still permitted.\nDespite the push back that Google has received, other big tech companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM continue to engage in work supporting the weaponization of AI with the Pentagon. These companies too have had to deal with internal discontent and have resorted to moving employees to different projects when they object. Despite the internal challenges, Amazon continues to work with the government on controversial facial recognition programs and Microsoft has continued with a cloud-computing project known as JEDI.\nFor now, the Pentagon has been unable to attract the talent required to develop AI technologies internally and thus has had to resort to partnering with the likes of the big tech firms. In China, the funding and control of these companies is linked directly to the CCP, which has given rise to the Sesame Credit system. At the risk of sounding cliche, Sesame Credit is an Orwellian system of social control predicated on the complicity of big tech companies and AI to track the citizenry\u2019s purchases and behaviors, incentivizing them to behave in party-approved ways and punishing them when they veer away. Punishments include restrictions on travel, loans, housing, business, and banking. The official goal of the program is to encompass all citizens and, \u201callow the trustworthy to roam everywhere under heaven, while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step.\u201d\nPerhaps most insidiously, it encourages social ostracization by reducing your score based on the score of those in your network. Thus you are encouraged to drop friends and family from your life if they aren\u2019t behaving in a party-approved manner.\nWhile the US is not China, we are living in a world where the NSA has obliterated 4th Amendment rights and where US presidents assert the legal authority to kill US citizens without charges or a trial. A national AI strategy that further links the US government with the tech companies and researchers puts us one step closer to China, but not as a leader in AI, rather as a country that leverages this technology to suppress people. One can only hope that backlash associated with Project Maven grows with respect to other Pentagon projects leaving the Department of Defense without the capabilities to weaponize AI as they seek.\n1.

Social understanding of the reality of marijuana use is slowly coming to pass; it is now uncommon for many people to believe the tired half-truths and aggressive propaganda foisted by D.A.R.E and other Law Enforcement Agencies surrounding the cannabis plant.\nRacism, Ignorance Mostly to Blame for Prohibition\nInitially, prohibition of marijuana or \u201cmarihuana\u201d in the Western world was primarily a racist backlash against Mexican workers and other immigrants who worked in the southern states of the United States \u2013 later that focus would shift to black Jazz musicians and other social minorities and marginals who were easily cast as \u201cthe Other\u201d to a largely white, suburban demographic.\nTo read more about the basis of marijuana prohibition, please click here.\nOrganically Grown CBD Oil and Products Available (Ad)\nHistory, Medicinal Use of a Relatively Benign Substance\nThe history of cannabis does not begin there, however \u2013 it is a plant that has been used since at least well before the time of Jesus Christ to reduce pain, to relax the body and soul, and to heal and alleviate sickness and the associated symptoms of many illnesses. In the history of civilized existence, there have been exactly zero cases of death directly attributed to marijuana use \u2013 according to the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA).\nIt is physically impossible to overdose on marijuana. Further, medical research suggests that it is impossible to develop a physical addiction to cannabis as well. While long-term marijuana smoking has been shown to increase the chance of developing bronchitis, evidence compiled by the largest case-controlled study of its kind by Dr. Donald Tashkin indicates absolutely no correlation between heavy use of marijuana and increased incidence of lung cancers. (Source)\nBy comparing and contrasting these facts alone with those surrounding socially accepted drugs such as tobacco and alcohol \u2013 let alone a plethora of toxic and extremely addictive prescription pharmaceuticals \u2013 the hypocrisy surrounding the \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d becomes evident to most critical thinkers.\nThe Real Cost of the \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d\nAside from the tens of billions of dollars in lucrative federal revenue that could be accumulated by simple legalization and taxation of the cannabis plant, and also not accounting for the millions of dollars spent enforcing antiquated prohibition laws \u2013 there is a very real human cost associated with the \u201cWar on Drugs.\u201d\nIn 2017 alone, there were 659,700 people arrested on marijuana-related charges in the United States. Of those persons 599,282 were arrested for simple possession. In other words, more than half a million persons a year in the United States are arrested for choosing a safer, healthier, and more productive medicine or recreational drug than alcohol, tobacco, prescription pharmaceuticals, or even aspirin \u2013 aspirin being responsible for thousands of deaths per year in the United States.\nIn a society that supposedly rests a great deal of its foundation on the principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness \u2013 it seems extremely hypocritical, illogical, and farcical to continue this misguided and propaganda-fueled war on our fellow citizens. When heart disease (heavily influenced by extremely fatty diets and obesity) continues to be the leading cause of death of death in America \u2013 killing over 1800 people each day \u2013 it seems foolish and unjust to jail more than half a million persons a year in the West for choosing a substance which has never killed a single human being since its recorded use.\nArjun is an independent researcher, writer, speaker and a consciousness activist.

Frank\nLast week Activist Post published an article about Sprint finally agreeing to remove the cell tower from California school with 8 cancer diagnoses in 3 years. Not surprisingly, students have been reportedly suffering from more than cancer since that tower was installed. From a 2017 petition to remove the tower:\nEight years later we are now seeing the probable effects of the installation of this tower . Two 5th grade students were diagnosed with cancer during the 2016-2017 school year. They have both attended Weston Elementary since Kindergarten. We have also seen two staff members diagnosed with cancer, as well as many students who have had several types of health issues for no apparent reason including digestive issues, headaches, and tiredness to name a few.\nFederal \u201csafety\u201d standards for exposure to cell towers and other wireless devices and infrastructure are outdated and inadequate. In fact, no \u201csafe\u201d level of cell phone and wireless WiFi radiation exposure has even been scientifically determined for children or pregnant women.\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is supposed to protect the public by regulating the Telecom Industry. Instead they do the exact opposite. FCC exposure limits are merely guidelines that they adopted from the Telecom Industry. Safety standards have not yet been set.\nIn the FCC\u2019s own words, \u201cthere is no federally developed national standard for safe levels of exposure to radiofrequency (RF) energy\u201d\nIt gets worse.\nTheir \u201csafe\u201d limits are based ONLY on short-term thermal considerations \u2013 meaning the level of RF radiation exposure over 30 minutes that would cause human tissue to heat up. So as long as there isn\u2019t enough radiation coming from a cell tower (or anything else) to cause that, it is deemed \u201csafe.\u201d\nNot only that, The FCC limit is 1000uW/cm2 for 30 minutes for Wi-Fi and most cell phone frequencies are NOT based on any scientific studies which have determined the level of RF radiation exposure that is safe for long-term exposure.\nCancer clusters near cell towers have been reported at locations all over the world. People everywhere (including some elected officials) are trying to keep them away from school property (See 1, 2) obviously for good reason.\nSince 2004, even The International Association of Firefighters (IAFF) has opposed the use of their stations for cell towers and antennas because of health risks.\nWith everything we already know, installing a cell tower near anywhere people (or animals) spend long periods of time is deliberately setting them up for illness \u2013 even if it\u2019s not immediate.

Children are especially vulnerable and many insurance companies aren\u2019t covering exposure effects anymore. There is too much research that has already proven it is harmful. It\u2019s also not just about increased cancer risk and brain tumors.\nResearch has proven it can disrupt the blood-brain barrier which can cause it to leak.\nResearch has proven that exposure can cause bacteria to become antibiotic resistant.\nResearch has proven that exposure can worsen pre-existing conditions even if it didn\u2019t cause them.\nResearch has proven that exposure may have a cumulative toxic effect when combined with other toxins.\nExposure can also cause \u201cMicrowave Sickness\u201d which is now more commonly referred to as ElectroSensitivity(ES) or ElectroHypersensitivity (EHS). Symptoms and severity vary so it can be easily misdiagnosed.\nBecause of these health risks, an increasing number of schools in the U.S. and overseas are also replacing wireless (WiFi) internet with safer wired internet. Many doctors have been recommending this for a while now, too.\nFor more information, visit the following websites:\nCenter For Safer Wireless\nCenter For Electrosmog Prevention\nCitizens for Safe Technology\nClear Light Ventures\nDr. Madga Havas\nDr. Sam Milham\nEMF Safety Network\nEnvironmental Health Trust\nGeneration Zapped\nNational Association for Children and Safe Technology\nPARENTS ACT \u2013 Parents Against Cell Towers\nParents for Safe Technology\nSaferEMR\nSafeTechForSchools\nScientists for Wired Tech\nWe Are The Evidence\nBy Daisy Luther\nYesterday, CIBC reported a \u201csystems issue\u201d that prevented customers from logging in to their accounts online for the entire business day. CIBC, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, is one of the five biggest banks in Canada. Yesterday just happened to be the day that people receiving welfare, unemployment benefits, social insurance payments (like American social security), Canada Pension payments, and disability payments landed in the accounts of recipients.\nCustomers could still use ATMs and Point of Sale features but were unable to log into their accounts to check balances, transfer money, or make online payments. The sentiments of normally patient Canadians online were \u2026 tense.\nThe system was restored around 8 pm last night but that wasn\u2019t soon enough for people who wanted to pay their bills by the due date or make business transactions.\nMeanwhile, CIBC wants to move everything online\nIronically, this online banking catastrophe occurred a day after Victor Dodig, the CEO of CIBC, predicted that nearly all transactions would soon be taking place online.\n\u2026almost all transactions will soon be conducted remotely, rather than in person, as customers continue to take more of their business and daily lives online.\n\u201cWe see continued migration of clients to do transactions remotely,\u201d CIBC CEO Victor Dodig said Wednesday during his bank\u2019s institutional investor conference in Montreal. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing 87 per cent of transactions now being done remotely. And we think it\u2019s going to get to 96 per cent over the next four to five years.\u201d (source)\nBut perhaps this migration has more to do with CIBC closing branches. Physical locations where you can walk in and see a teller are going the way of the Canadian penny. (It\u2019s no longer being made because production costs were 1.6 cents per coin.)\nSince before 2000, CIBC has been closing dozens of branches every year. And it isn\u2019t just CIBC that is closing branches in Canada. It\u2019s a trend across all the Big 5 banks and thousands of jobs have been lost.\nSo the question is, do Canadians actually \u201cprefer\u201d online banking, or do they have no other choice due to physical location closures?\nThis makes me think of the whole push toward a cashless society.\nFor a long time now, Big Finance has been \u201cnudging\u201d people along toward an end that would benefit them greatly \u2013 a cashless society.\nIf a powerful institution wants to make people choose a certain thing, the best strategy is to make it difficult to choose the alternative.\nWe can illustrate this with the example of self-checkout tills at supermarkets. The underlying agenda is to replace checkout staff with self-service machines to cut costs. But supermarkets have to convince their customers. They thus initially present self-checkout as a convenient alternative. When some people then use that alternative, the supermarket can cite that as evidence of a change in customer behaviour, which they then use to justify a reduction in checkout employees. This in turn makes it more inconvenient to use the checkout staff, which in turn makes customers more likely to use the machines. They slowly wean you off staff, and \u201cnudge\u201d you towards self-service.\nFinancial institutions, likewise, are trying to nudge us towards a cashless society and digital banking. The true motive is corporate profit. Payments companies such as Visa and Mastercard want to increase the volume of digital payments services they sell, while banks want to cut costs. The nudge requires two parts. First, they must increase the inconvenience of cash, ATMs and branches. Second, they must vigorously promote the alternative. They seek to make people \u201clearn\u201d that they want digital, and then \u201cchoose\u201d it. (source)\nIt won\u2019t surprise many people to learn that this has links to Marxist philosophy.\nThe Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci developed the concept of cultural hegemony out of Karl Marx\u2019s theory that the dominant ideology of society reflects the beliefs and interests of the ruling class. Gramsci argued that consent to the rule of the dominant group is achieved by the spread of ideologies\u2014beliefs, assumptions, and values\u2014through social institutions such as schools, churches, courts, and the media, among others. These institutions do the work of socializing people into the norms, values, and beliefs of the dominant social group. As such, the group that controls these institutions controls the rest of society.\nCultural hegemony is most strongly manifested when those ruled by the dominant group come to believe that the economic and social conditions of their society are natural and inevitable, rather than created by people with a vested interest in particular social, economic, and political orders. (source)\nOh yay. Who doesn\u2019t love being \u201cnudged\u201d along the road to Marxism and a cashless utopia? (This is sarcasm. Hold the angry comments and emails.)\nHere\u2019s why a cashless society is dangerous.\nA cashless society is a danger to freedom. And this is why we should embrace cold hard cash, precious metals, and the barter system.\nMost of the folks who will read this article will already be on board with this philosophy, but here is one of the best explanations I\u2019ve read about the dangers. From The UK Guardian\u2026\nDigital systems may be \u201cconvenient\u201d, but they often come with central points of failure. Cash, on the other hand, does not crash. It does not rely on external data centres, and is not subject to remote control or remote monitoring. The cash system allows for an unmonitored \u201coff the grid\u201d space. This is also the reason why financial institutions and financial technology companies want to get rid of it. Cash transactions are outside the net that such institutions cast to harvest fees and data.\nA cashless society brings dangers. People without bank accounts will find themselves further marginalised, disenfranchised from the cash infrastructure that previously supported them. There are also poorly understood psychological implications about cash encouraging self-control while paying by card or a mobile phone can encourage spending. And a cashless society has major surveillance implications.\nDespite this, we see an alignment between government and financial institutions. The Treasury recently held a public consultation on cash and digital payments in the new economy. It presented itself as attempting to strike a balance, noting that cash was still important. But years of subtle lobbying by the financial industry have clearly paid off. The call for evidence repeatedly notes the negative elements of cash \u2013 associating it with crime and tax evasion \u2013 but barely mentions the negative implications of digital payments.\nThe UK government has chosen to champion the digital financial services industry. This is irresponsible and disingenuous. We need to stop accepting stories about the cashless society and hyper-digital banking being \u201cnatural progress\u201d. We must recognise every cash machine that is shut down as another step in financial institutions\u2019 campaign to nudge you into their digital enclosures. (source)\nIt only took one day of the CIBC debacle to remind people of why digital transactions are at the mercy of the computers and those who control them.\nThe people who are pleading for the \u201cprogress\u201d of a cashless society, the ones who can\u2019t wait to get their debit card embedded into their arms as an RFID chip \u2013 they aren\u2019t seeing the bigger picture. That\u2019s the picture of them, losing everything they have at the whim of a bank, a prosecutor, or a computer error. It\u2019s the picture of every single thing you buy and every transaction you make being tracked, filed away, and one day used against you.\nIt\u2019s all about control. It\u2019s always about control.\nAnd without cash, you just handed all of your control to someone else.\nHat tip to Connie from Canada\nPlease feel free to share any information from this site in part or in full, leaving all links intact, giving credit to the author and including a link to this website and the following bio.
